Question 01: Provide responses to the following questions about the dataset.
1. How many instances does the dataset contain?   its = 80
2. How many input attributes does the dataset contain? its = 7
3. How many possible values does the output attribute have? Its 2 
4. How many input attributes are categorical? 2 (HAIR AND COLOR)
5. What is the class ratio (male vs female) in the dataset? 46 MALE AND 34 FAMALE (46: 34-->23: 17--> 1.35: 1)

Question 02: Apply Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Multilayer Perceptron classification algorithms
(using Python) on the gender prediction dataset with standard train/test split ratio and answer the following
questions.

1) Standard Train/Test Split
92% accuracy: So 3 instances were incorrectly classified using the Random Forest algorithm.
74% accuracy: So 7 instances were incorrectly classified using the Support Vector Machine
algorithm.
55% accuracy: So 11 instances were incorrectly classified using the Multilayer Perceptron
Classifier.
2) 80/20 Train Test Split
100 % accuracy: So 0 instances were incorrectly classified using the Random Forest
algorithm.
81 % accuracy: So 5 instances were incorrectly classified using the Support Vector Machine
algorithm.
93% accuracy: So 2 instances were incorrectly classified using the Multilayer Perceptron
Classifier.
• In 80/20 split the accuracy of the model increases, which can be seen that less number of
instances were classified incorrectly.
3) Scarf and Beard are the most powerful attributes in the Prediction task because they have
distinct values for males and females in almost most of the instances.
4) By removing the above two attributes the accuracy of the system is reduced. Like by applying
specified classifier algorithms the accuracy compared to previous decreases.


Quesion 03:
Apply Decision Tree Classifier classification algorithm (using Python) on the gender prediction dataset
with Monte Carlo cross-validation and Leave P-Out cross-validation. Report F1 score for both cross-validation
strategies.
Note: You are free to choose any parameter values for both cross-validation strategies, however, you have to
provide these values in your submission document.

Monte Carlo cross-validation:
F1 Score: 0.94 Parameters: ShuffleSplit(train_size=0.66, test_size=0.34, n_splits = 5)
Leave P-Out cross-validation:
F1 Score: 0.96 Parameters: p=5 


Question 04: Add 5 sample instances into the dataset (you can ask your friends/relatives/sibling for the data). Rerun
the ML experiment (using Python) by training the model using Gaussian Naïve Bayes classification algorithm
and all the instances from the gender prediction dataset. Evaluate the trained model using the newly added test
instances. Report accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

5 instances for testing are:
I create another .csv file named as gender-prediction-test, and add the below 5 instances
for testing in that file. After applying the accuracy was 80%
1. height: 63, Beard: no, weight: 150, hair length: medium, shoe size: 41, scarf: yes, eye
color: blue, gender: female
2. height: 81, Beard: no, weight: 182, hair length: Short, shoe size: 38, scarf: NO, eye
color: brown, gender: female
3. height: 76, Beard: Yes, weight: 170, hair length: Long, shoe size: 37, scarf: NO, eye

4. height: 85, Beard: Yes, weight: 200, hair length: Bald, shoe size: 44, scarf: NO, eye
