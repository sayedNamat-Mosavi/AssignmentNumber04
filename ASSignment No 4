Question 01: Provide responses to the following questions about the dataset.
1. How many instances does the dataset contain?   its = 80
2. How many input attributes does the dataset contain? its = 7
3. How many possible values does the output attribute have? Its 2 
4. How many input attributes are categorical? 2 (HAIR AND COLOR)
5. What is the class ratio (male vs female) in the dataset? 46 MALE AND 34 FAMALE (46: 34-->23: 17--> 1.35: 1)

Question 02: Apply Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Multilayer Perceptron classification algorithms
(using Python) on the gender prediction dataset with standard train/test split ratio and answer the following
questions.
1. How many instances are incorrectly classified?
i) 0
ii) 6
iii) 10
2. Rerun the experiment using train/test split ratio of 80/20. Do you see any change in the results?
Explain.
i) No,because there are some input atributes which are heavily impacting the output.
ii) Yes,3 instances are wrong now.
iii) Yes, 3 instances are wrong now
3. Name 2 attributes that you believe are the most “powerful” in the prediction task. Explain why?
   In my opinion, beard and hair, as a female can't have beard or be bald.
4. Try to exclude these 2 attribute(s) from the dataset. Rerun the experiment (using 80/20 train/test split),
did you find any change in the results? Explain.
i) No, because there might be other powerful attributes than excluded ones, or that there is a lot of data with not much vareity.
ii) No, because there might be other powerful attributes than excluded ones, or that there is a lot of data with not much vareity.
iii) Yes, 6 instances are wrong now.

Question 04: Add 5 sample instances into the dataset (you can ask your friends/relatives/sibling for the data). Rerun
the ML experiment (using Python) by training the model using Gaussian Naïve Bayes classification algorithm
and all the instances from the gender prediction dataset. Evaluate the trained model using the newly added test
instances. Report accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
Note: You have to add the test instances in your assignment submission document.
Data:- new_input = [(65, 120, 0, 3, 36, 1, 0), (68, 180, 1, 0, 40, 1, 2), (72, 180, 1, 2, 44, 0, 1), (67, 170, 0, 0, 40, 1, 1),(70, 176, 0, 3, 44, 1, 1)]
       new_output = ['female','male','male','female','female']
Accuracy: 80%
Precision:  0   75%
            1   100%
Recall:     0   1
            1   0.5
